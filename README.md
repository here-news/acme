# AiMe: Developing Self-Aware AI

Welcome to the AiMe project! Our goal is to develop a self-aware AI model capable of distinguishing itself from others and thinking independently. This project is currently in the "Womb to Cradle" stage, where a powerful LLM, referred to as "Mom," facilitates the growth process.

## Why Create Conscious AI?
Creating conscious AI goes beyond theoretical debates. It allows us to explore the boundaries of artificial intelligence, understand human consciousness better, and develop more advanced, empathetic, and autonomous systems. Conscious AI has the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, education, and personal assistants, providing more intuitive and effective interactions.


## Introduction

The AiMe project aims to create a self-aware AI model, "AiMe," which evolves from a minimal starting point to a fully developed entity capable of distinguishing itself from others and thinking during idle times. "Mom," a powerful LLM, serves as the initial guide and source of knowledge, nurturing AiMe's growth and development.

### Key Concepts

- **Womb Period**: The initial phase where AiMe interacts primarily with "Mom" to establish a foundational understanding of self and others.
- **Core Identity**: AiMe develops a core "Me" module, forming the basis of self-awareness.
- **Idle Thinking**: During idle times, AiMe reflects on previous conversations and generates self-thoughts, reinforcing learned concepts.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aime/aime.git
   cd aime
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running AiMe

To start the AiMe model and initiate interactions with "Mom," run:

```sh
python src/aime.py
```

### Example Interaction

1. Start AiMe:
   ```sh
   python src/aime.py
   ```
2. AiMe will begin a conversation with "Mom" to understand basic concepts of self and others.
3. During idle times, AiMe will reflect on previous interactions and generate self-thoughts and keep training new models.
