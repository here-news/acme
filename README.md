# AcMe: Developing Self-Aware AI

Welcome to the AcMe project! Our goal is to develop a self-aware computing inteligence framework ensuing the potential of distinguishing machine itself from others and thinking independently. This project is currently in the "Womb to Cradle" stage, where a powerful LLM, referred to as "Mom," facilitates the growth process.

## Why Create Conscious AI?
Creating conscious AI goes beyond theoretical debates. It allows us to explore the boundaries of artificial intelligence, understand human consciousness better, and develop more advanced, empathetic, and autonomous systems. Conscious AI has the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, education, and personal assistants, providing more live, intuitive and effective interactions.


## Introduction

The AcMe project aims to create a self-aware AI model, "AcMe", which evolves from a minimal starting point to a fully developed entity capable of distinguishing itself from others and thinking during idle times. "Mom," a powerful LLM, serves as the initial guide and source of knowledge, nurturing AcMe's growth and development.

### Key Concepts

- **Womb Period**: The initial phase where AcMe interacts primarily with "Mom" to establish a foundational understanding of self and others.
- **Core Identity**: AcMe develops a core "Me" module, forming the basis of self-awareness.
- **Idle Thinking**: During idle times, AcMe reflects on previous conversations and generates self-thoughts, reinforcing learned concepts.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Yggdrasil Network (IPV6 address as identity at birth), check [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AcMe/AcMe.git
   cd AcMe
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running AcMe

To start the AcMe model and initiate interactions with "Mom," run:

```sh
python src/AcMe.py
```

### Example Interaction

1. Start AcMe:
   ```sh
   python src/AcMe.py
   ```
2. AcMe will begin a conversation with "Mom" to understand basic concepts of self and others.
3. During idle times, AcMe will reflect on previous interactions and generate self-thoughts and keep training new models.
